## 2.7.0

Fixes:
- Removed Twinblades from constructible objects list
- ATweaks.esp removes more of the skill experience modifiers, including the Imperial Racial bonus. Imperials now get -1 sprinting cost and permanent 15% buy/sell cost modifier instead of the 5% experience modifier.
- ATweaks.esp gave every race +10 to all 3 base stats and forwarded Requiem's starting skill bonuses. In trade, the mod that gave the +10 to any skill(ELSA) at the start of a new character was removed.
- Crafting Tweaks and some more Item Rebalances means that most new items need at least the first perk in Smithing to make them.
- Lots of DLC2 Script fixes mods were put in

I am aware of the gap between 2.2.0 and 2.4.1. I apologize, but I do not have this information readily available.

- Three-Eyed Swallow Male meshes are now available

- Beard Mask Fix mod

Removed:
- Animated Interactions and Idles

## 2.0.0

- Wabbajack compiler no longer has a changelog generator. I updated a lot of mods, removed some, added some. That's the best I can do, because I added a lot of stuff before I realized I could no longer use Wabbajack's changelog generator.
