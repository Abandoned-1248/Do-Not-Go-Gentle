## Preamble

**NOTE**: Do Not Go Gentle **REQUIRES** the paid AE update to Skyrim.

Do Not Go Gentle is designed as Requiem modlist with Bruma, Wyrmstooth, and lots of other additions to extend the life of your character playthrough. I did not build this to be a painful list to play, but Requiem does make you plan out your actions more than vanilla Skyrim. I find my build to be a reasonable compromise between difficulty and enjoyment, and maybe you will too. It uses [Solas Weathers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49004) by default.

The full modlist can be viewed [here](https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/do-not-go-gentle)

Notable Mods: Skyrim Unbound Reborn, MCO, Precision, SCAR, TDM, Distar's Elden mods(Counter, Parry and Power Attack), Pit Fighter, Bruma, Wyrmstooth, Leaps of Faith, College of Winterhold Quest Expansion, Scholarship of Skyrim, Pilgrim, [SkyRe Racials](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17915), Honed Metal, More Carriages, and Wait Carriage in Towns(adds an option to wait for a carriage at any inn not inside a walled city), and Just Sleep(Sleep increases carry weight while sleep deprivation decrease carry weight). I cannot include them all here, so check the link above

## System Requirements

My Specs: 

Processor:	i9-12900k

GPU: 		3090

Ram: 		32GB

Storage:	2TB m.2 nvme

Pagefile:	40GB

ShaderCache:	10GB

I tend to test in 4k, and play in 2k with these specs. In 4k, I rarely see it drop below 60fps except in some spots around Riverwood, Falkreath, or Riften. In 2k, it typically stays above 100fps.

As you might see, I have a problem suggesting minimum requirements because of my higher end computer. However, if you have run Serenity, AVO, or a list similar, I don't think you should have a problem with this. 

Recommended for 1080:

Processor:	8 Core/16 Thread CPU. i9-9900k or better.

GPU: 		6-8GB or more

Ram: 		16+GB

Storage: 	SSD or m.2 nvme

Pagefile: 	20-40GB

ShaderCache:	This is only available to those on nVidia, but I recommend setting it to 10GB if you do have nVidia

Space required: Approx post install size of 202GB (134 GB Install and 68 GB of downloads included)

## Installation

Installing DNGG is relatively easy and, if you have Nexus Premium, will be a simple waiting game. If you are updating the modlist, you can safely skip to the [updating section](#updating).

### Pre-Installation

Prior to installing DNGG, please complete the following steps.

1. Install [Visual C++ x64](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) & [.Net Runtime v5 desktop x64](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0/runtime).
2. Change Skyrim so it does not [automatically update](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/71AB-698D-57EB-178C#disable).
3. Fully uninstall Skyrim by deleting the folder and the Skyrim Special edition folder inside \Documents\My Games\.
4. Reinstall Skyrim into a location that is not Program files. Somewhere like `C:\Games` is a good location.
5. Start the game once and let it do the graphics check. Do not worry about the settings as it will be replaced during installation.
6. You also need to start the games to the main menu in order to download all the creations.

### Wabbajack Installation

#### Installing Wabbajack

Once you have completed pre-installation, download the [latest version of Wabbajack]((https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/releases)) and place it in a folder such as `C:\Games\Wabbajack`. Do not place it in program files, on your desktop or in your downloads folder. I recommend placing it on an SSD as it will work quicker on there.

#### Downloading and Installing DNGG

Downloading and installing DNGG can take a while depending on your internet connection and computer. To install DNGG, complete the following steps.

1. Open Wabbajack and click on browse modlists.
2. Make sure the `show unofficial lists` checkbox is ticked
![UnofficialListHelp](https://github.com/chri3i/Ruvaak-Readme/blob/main/.github/UnofficialListHelp.png)
3. Press the download button on DNGG and wait for it to download.
4. Set the installation folder to be somewhere like `C:\DNGG`. **Do not install it to your desktop or downloads folder.**
5. The download location does not need to be on a SSD but it makes installing a bit faster
6. Press the play button to begin.
7. Go and pet your nearest fluffy animal whilst Wabbajack does its thing. Alternatively read through this readme again.
8. If the installation is successful, jump for joy and move onto [post installation](#post-installation). If the installation is unsuccessful, follow what is below.

##### Problems with installation

It is possible that you may encounter an error with Wabbajack when installing. Some common issues are listed below.

- Could not download x:
	- Big files can fail to download due to connection issues. You can either run wabbajack again or download the file manually. If you decide to manually download it, make sure to place it in the same place as the other downloads.
	- Make sure that you have downloaded **all** of the creation club content. **THIS LIST WILL NOT RUN WITHOUT IT!**

- x is not a whitelisted download:

	 - This will happen when I update the modlist. Please check if there is a new update or wait until you see a release ping.

- Wabbajack could not find my game folder:

	- Either buy the game or go back to the [Pre-Installation](#pre-installation) step.

- Antivirus reports a virus:
	- Windows 10/11 may automatically quarantine a key file which is needed for Mod Organizer. You can fix this by [adding an exclusion for Mod Organizer in windows defender](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/exclude-a-folder-from-windows-security-scan).

## Post-Installation

### Game Folder

DNGG uses a Wabbajack feature called Stock Game to keep your Skyrim installation clean. All the files that you need to run the list are in a folder called `Game Root`. You donâ€™t need to copy anything at all.

### ENB
DNGG is designed for use with an ENB and comes with [E.V.C. ENB]([https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/71743]), already activated and ready for use. The ENB has been custom tweaked for the list to match the intended look, feel and performance of the list. 

I have also included Heidel's Reshade, as I love the combined look with EVC ENB

If you wish to install your own ENB, however, an ENB manager is included. Simply put your new ENB into a seperate folder in `DNGG\Tools\ENB Organizer\Games\SkyrimSE\Presets`.

#### Using ENB Manager

Head over to the installation folder and locate an executable named `ModOrganizer.exe` and launch it. Once it's launched, there will be a dropdown box on the top right and a big `Run` button next to it. Run the program named `Pick Your ENB` from Mod Organizer 2.

![image](https://github.com/The-Animonculory/Animonculory-Visual-Overhaul/blob/main/.github/ENB%201.png?raw=true)

If the image below comes up, simply press OK. It is nothing to be concerned about.

![image](https://github.com/The-Animonculory/Animonculory-Visual-Overhaul/blob/main/.github/Ignore%20Warning.png?raw=true)

Navigate to the Presets menu by pressing the symbol in the top left (the three lines). The menu should look like this:

![image](https://github.com/The-Animonculory/Animonculory-Visual-Overhaul/blob/main/.github/ENB%203.png?raw=true)

Activate the ENB you wish to use by pressing the slider. To deactivate it, simply press the slider.

![image](https://github.com/The-Animonculory/Animonculory-Visual-Overhaul/blob/main/.github/ENB%205.png)

For adding your own presets and more details, take a look at [ENB Organizer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/67077) for more information.

## Playing the List

### Starting up the list
Open the installation folder and double click on the program called `ModOrganizer.exe`. 

Make sure the dropdown box on the right is set to `SKSE` and press the `Run` button.

### In-Game MCM options

DNGG has no MCM options required, since MCM Recorder will run automatically. However, please test out the different smoothcam presets available and feel free to tinker any settings in the MCM menu.

### Starting the Game

By default, DNGG uses [Skyrim Unbound Reborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27962).

Skyrim Unbound is an alternate start mod with a wide range of options. It allows the player to skip the opening sequence, choose whether or not to play as the Dragonborn, and have total control over dragon spawns. The first few chapters of the main questline have been bypassed (and effectively removed), meaning you no longer have to obtain the Dragonstone for Farengar or defeat Mirmulnir for the Jarl of Whiterun. If you do wish to play as the Dragonborn and complete the main quest, all you have to do is absorb a dragon soul and you'll be summoned to High Hrothgar by the Greybeards.

Be sure to also choose "Dragon Souls" in the Unbound MCM if you want to play as a Dragonborn. Failing to do so will result in you not being able to play the main questline with your created character. There is no reverting your decision later down the line, so be sure you want to play as a non-Dragonborn before choosing otherwise. I also would recommend to disable "Spawn in Jail" and "Spawn in the Wilderness", as sometimes this can lead to issues, such as you finding yourself in a place where you can't easily get out of. Solstheim is also a rather tough place to spawn in. It's a DLC area not meant to be visited before you reach a certain level, so starting there might really put you in a tough spot. I wouldn't recommend it unless you're really wanting a challenge.

After choosing your starting point in Unbound, hit Let's Go in the MCM. You will then spawn into a room where you generate your character. Finish and name your character and select Stay Here in the pop up. Let all the messages disappear in the top left, please. 

_You will see a message pop up to initialize Requiem._ Open your inventory and close it to do this before leaving the starting room.

After that, you can use the ["Choose your Destiny!"](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72410) scroll in your inventory to choose a class and the "Reflect" power in your powers list to give you 10 skill points in a skill of your choosing. These two are a boon to your chosen path and should help you start off slightly easier. Note that the scroll comes with some trade offs that could be pretty weird later on, but you don't *have to use it. 

One more thing, Requiem gives you three perks to start out with. I would suggest taking one in light or heavy armor, if you plan to use it for your character. Requiem makes survival and enjoyment slightly dependent on taking perks in the skill you would like to use. For instance, wearing Heavy Armor without the first perk will drain your stamina, which could spell death, in the right situation. Light Armor will also drain your stamina while running, without the first perk. Weapons become much more effective with the first perk, and spells are almost impossible without the first perk in the related school. Again, you get three to start out with, and I feel that is reasonable.

Last thing, I have an insane person's custom button mapping. Please change the vanilla controls to your liking, but remember [Elden Power Attack](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/66711)'s key is set to the "Shift" key by default. You need it to be able to power attack.

Once you are ready to spawn in, hit the Enter key and select Continue. Good Luck! Also, don't forget to get some sleep.
	
## Adding mods to DNGG

I have included Autobody AE for the purpose of giving people some sense of semi-realistic body variance, so any CBBE bodyslide you want to use will work by just installing it like a normal mod and then applying that body in the in-game menu. To open that in-game menu, press the ; button in game and choose your bodyslide.

I know you may want to add some extra mods on top of this. I also know I will not stop you from doing so; therefore, I have to say that I can only help you to the fullest of my ability if you _have not_ added any mods. ENBs, racemenu presets, and cbbe bodyslide presets are an exception to this rule. 

As a suggestion: _DO NOT_ put any additional mods with plugins below the paper maps, but preferably they should go above DynDOLOD.esp.

## Updating the modlist

Before updating, please check the changelog and back up your saves. You may need to start a new game after certain updates.

Updating is like installing the list. Simply make sure your paths are the same and tick the `overwrite existing modlist` button. **Note**: Any mods you have added will be deleted when updating.

## FAQ

Placehoder for your Readme.

### Tweaking the Game Settings

#### BethINI

To get some more FPS, tweak the following value in the detail section in BethINI.

- `Shadow Resolution`: 2048
- `Ambient Occlusion`: Either use this or the ENB version. The ENB version is more intensive. Do not have both turned on.
- `Remove Shadows`: I really donâ€™t recommend turning this on, but if you must, then you can.

#### ENB

DNGG ships with an ENB and Reshade setup that is configured to match the look of the list. If you wish to make some changes though, here are a few common tweaks. I recommend opening the console before doing edits.

##### Removing the letterbox (in general as the default ENB doesn't have that effect enabled)

1. Press [Shift+Enter] to open the ENB menu.
2. In the tab called Shader Parameters, select the `ENBPOSTPASS.FX` section. It will open once you click on it.
3. Scroll down until you see letterbox and untick it.
4. Press the save configuration button.
5. Press [Shift+Enter] to return to the game.

##### Turning off settings for FPS

If you are struggling for frames but want the colour correction and realism, turn off the following items.

- DetailedShadows
- ComplexFireLights
- ComplexParticleLights â€“ Disable Big Range
- Reflection
- Complex Grass Collision
- Complex Grass
 
If your computer cannot handle both the ENB and Reshade, the Page Up button will toggle the reshade while in game, and feel free to turn it off in the ENB Manager. EVC ENB still looks pretty good without the reshade.

If you really cannot handle the ENB, the Page Down button will toggle the ENB while in game. Note that this will make the list look much worse and it's not intended to be played like that.

## Removing the Modlist
Simply delete the folder, and you have uninstalled it.
